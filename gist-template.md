# Title (replace with your title)

Regular expressions, or regex, are an essential tool for searching and manipulating text data. In this guide, we'll explore the components of regex and how they can be used to create powerful patterns for matching and manipulating text.

## Summary

In this guide, we'll discuss the components of regular expressions and how to use them effectively. We'll cover anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. Here's a simple regex example that we'll dissect throughout the guide: /^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{8,}$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors help define the position of the pattern in the input string. The most common anchors are ^ (start of the string) and $ (end of the string).

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers define how many times a character, character class, or a group should repeat. Common quantifiers include * (0 or more), + (1 or more), ? (0 or 1), and {n,m} (between n and m times).

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs are used to group characters or expressions. They can be used with quantifiers, alternation, or backreferences.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define a character set that can match any single character from the set. They are enclosed in square brackets [ ].

### Character Classes
Character classes are a shorthand for specific sets of characters. Some examples include \d (digits), \w (word characters), and \s (whitespace).

### The OR Operator
The OR operator (|) allows you to match either the expression before or after it.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex pattern. Common flags include g (global), i (case-insensitive), and m (multiline).

### Character Escapes
Character escapes are used to treat special characters as literals or to specify special characters that are otherwise hard to type.
